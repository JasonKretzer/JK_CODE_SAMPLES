I was bored and wrote an implementation of a Vector in 2003 and applied it to an Ecosystem simulation.  Looking back on this, I see a number of things that I would do differently.

To Execute:
Compile to an executable (I will use generic a.out)
Then execute with optional number of simulated weeks to run the simulation.
./a.out [SOME NUMBER OF WEEKS]

If a non-integer is passed, the simulation will run for 1 simulated week.
