A few code samples.

Most of my work is obviously of a proprietary nature.  As such, I have tried adding some code here that satisfies two conditions:
<ol>
	<li> is generic enough to not be infringing anything else I have written </li>
	<li> decent enough to show that I do indeed understand these concepts</li>
</ol>
<strong>Folder:</strong> DI_IOC_Observer
<br />
This folder contains examples of Dependency Injection, Inversion of Control, and the Observer Pattern.  There are three samples of code that have similar functionality but written in C#, PHP, and Java.  They are all three fairly simple and take advantage of the built-in Observer capabilities(interfaces) of each language.
