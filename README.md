A few code samples.

Most of my work is obviously of a proprietary nature.  As such, I have tried adding some code here that satisfies two conditions:
1.) is generic enough to not be infringing anything else I have written 
2.) decent enough to show that I do indeed understand these concepts

Folder: DI_IOC_Observer
This folder contains two samples of code that have similar functionality but written in PHP and Java.  C# will be coming soon.
