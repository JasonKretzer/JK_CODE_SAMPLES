A few code samples.

Most of my work is obviously of a proprietary nature.  As such, I have tried adding some code here that satisfies two conditions:
<ol>
	<li> is generic enough to not be infringing anything else I have written </li>
	<li> decent enough to show that I do indeed understand these concepts</li>
</ol>
<strong>Folder:</strong> DI_IOC_Observer
<br />
This folder contains examples of Dependency Injection, Inversion of Control, and the Observer Pattern.  Currently, there are two samples of code that have similar functionality but written in PHP and Java.  C# will be coming soon.
