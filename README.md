A few code samples.

Most of my work is obviously of a proprietary nature.  As such, I have tried adding some code here that satisfies these conditions:
<ol>
	<li> is generic enough to not be infringing anything else I have written </li>
	<li> decent enough to show that I do indeed understand these concepts</li>
	<li> varied enough to show a wide range of concepts</li>
	<li> cut across varied stages of my career</li>
</ol>

I am continuing to fill this out so that I can provide some more modern code.

<strong>Folder:</strong> DI_IOC_Observer (2015)
<br />
This folder contains examples of Dependency Injection, Inversion of Control, and the Observer Pattern.  There are three samples of code that have similar functionality but written in C#, PHP, and Java.  They are all three fairly simple and take advantage of the built-in Observer capabilities(interfaces) of each language.

<strong>Folder:</strong> FoobarParser (2003)
<br />
This folder contains example of a very generic parser written Java.  I wrote this in grad school, and can see some improvements that I may some day make, particularly with the long line of if/else statements.  Regardless, not a bad first shot at establishing a grammar.
<br /><br />
<strong>Folder:</strong> ConnectFour (2004)
<br />
This folder contains example of a ConnectFour network game written Java.  It contains a server and client.  Must have two players.  I also wrote this in grad school as a proof of concept.
