A few code samples.

Most of my work is obviously of a proprietary nature. As such, I have tried adding some code here that satisfies these conditions:

1. Is generic enough to not be infringing anything else I have written
2. Decent enough to show that I do indeed understand these concepts
3. Varied enough to show a wide range of concepts
4. Cut across varied stages of my career

**Folder:** DI_IOC_Observer (2015)  
This folder contains examples of Dependency Injection, Inversion of Control, and the Observer Pattern. There are three samples of code that have similar functionality but written in C#, PHP, and Java. They are all three fairly simple and take advantage of the built-in Observer capabilities (interfaces) of each language.

**Folder:** FoobarParser (2003) -- Java  
This folder contains an example of a very generic parser written in Java. I wrote this in grad school, and can see some improvements that I may someday make, particularly with the long line of if/else statements. Regardless, not a bad first shot at establishing a grammar.

**Folder:** ConnectFour (2004) -- Java  
This folder contains an example of a ConnectFour network game written in Java. It contains a server and client. Must have two players. I also wrote this in grad school as a proof of concept.

**Folder:** Ecosystem Simulation (2003) -- C++  
This folder contains a sample generic Vector implementation written in C++. It is used in a simple Ecosystem simulation. I remember being proud of it, but as usual, looking back I see so many things I would do differently.
